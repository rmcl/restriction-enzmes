A simple package for working with restriction enzymes in go. The library `script` package is able to download the REBASE distribution via FTP and generates go source files in the `db` package including a map of `Enzyme` with each of the available restriction enzymes.

The `enzyme` package contains structs and routines for working with batches of enzymes and determining where they will cut double stranded DNA sequences.

The `sequence` package contains the Dseq struct that represents a double stranded DNA sequence. Dseq contains `Cut` which will return the fragments of DNA generated by the cutting action of the provided restriction enzyme or batch of enzymes.
